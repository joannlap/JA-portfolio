                    <p>The goal of this concept to is encourage festival visitors to take a Spotify subscription.
                        Spotify
                        has to promote their streaming service in an interactive way during a festival or event.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This <span class='heading-primary-colored-4'>concept</span> consist of a physical
                        (any object or area) and digital component (user
                        interface).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For the <span class='heading-primary-colored-3'>physical component</span> I created a
                        hangout area, where visitors can chill or recover
                        from the crowds outside. But the whole purpose of this hangout is to demonstrate the digital
                        component through touchscreen panels, letting the user experience the app and hopefully
                        urges
                        them to download the application.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I merged Woohah and Spotify into one app for the <span class='heading-primary-colored-3'>digital
                            component</span>.</p>

                    <p> Both Woohah and Spotify manages an app so I decided to bring out the main elements of Spotify
                        and merging that into the Woohah app (where I created an own version of).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Woohah app contains all the info about the festival from maps to schedules which is a must
                        for all the visitors.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I saw this as a strategic opportunity to make it attractive for the users taking the
                        subscription, because by using the Woohah app you are experiencing the use of Spotify at the
                        same time.</p>
