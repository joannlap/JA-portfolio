                    <p>The goal of this concept to is encourage festival visitors to take a Spotify subscription.
                        Spotify
                        wants to promote their streaming service in an interactive way during a festival or event.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This <span class='heading-primary-colored-4'>concept</span> consists of a physical
                        (any object or area) and digital component (user
                        interface).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For the <span class='heading-primary-colored-3'>physical component</span> I created a hangout
                        area, where visitors can relax from the busy crowds outside. Besides that, this hangout is built
                        to demonstrate the application through touchscreen panels, letting the user try the application
                        themselves encouraging them to download the app.</p>

            <div class="shade">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I merged Woohah and Spotify into one app for the <span class='heading-primary-colored-3'>digital
                            component</span>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Woohah app is a digital guide to get you through the festival during the weekend. From maps
                        to schedules which is a must
                        for all the visitors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Both Woohah and Spotify manages an app and I brought out the main elements of Spotify and
                        combined that with the Woohah app (which I created my own version of).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I saw this as a strategic opportunity to making it more attractive for users taking the
                        subscription. By combining the two apps the user is determined to download the app in order to
                        find its way through the festival and also has the chance to make use out of Spotify at the same
                        time.
