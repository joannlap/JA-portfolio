        <h2>2D game inspired by the manga
          “Promised Neverland”</h2>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>In 2021 I followed the minor Applied Game Design, this was my first encounter with game design and
            development. The first project we were asked to build a 2D platform game in five weeks. Pressure was on, but
            it was hella fun. Also, this minor showed me a different approach to interaction design which is very
            interesting.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>I was very intrigued by the storytelling of the manga “Promised Neverland” that made the starting point for
            my game; The Orphans. The orphans tells the story about Conny who’s one of the ten orphans that escaped from
            the orphanage after they found out they life in a world where kids are raised to be livestock for demons.
            The
            game starts when Conny is wandering through the creepy forest with the goal to find ingredients in order to
            create this recipe that needs to end the children livestock for demons. Along the way Conny has to face
            poisoned vegetation obstacles and demons to collect the ingredients.

        <section class="alinea">
          <p>This was a individual project, I partially created my own assets (character, items, UI, enemy) the rest I
            got
            through the asset store provided by Unity. Everything was build in Unity and the audio was originated from
            different sources.

        <h6>Research</h6>
        <p>To find out what mechanics I want to use for my game, I played a few games that
          fits my story. The storytelling shows that the protagonist eliminates the enemy with swords and handmade
          weapons. Therefore I chose for sword attacks as the main mechanic. Afterwards I created moodboards
          regarding to the environment, level design and characters to showcase what type of ambience I wanted to
          implement
          in the game. </p>

          <h6>Design proces</h6>
          <p>Based on the moodboards and prior research, I wanted to create a dark forest setting with good amount of
            platforming
            where the character has to go through different obstacles and slay enemies. Eventually collecting all the
            items. Here showing some character sprites and level design sketches I drew for my game </p>

        <h6>The final product</h6>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>After five weeks of many iterations and testing, I built a game that at first is quite slow paced but it
            can get challenging later on. The goal is to survive the obstacles
            and enemies in order to collect all the ingredients. </p>
