        <h2>2D game inspired by the manga
          “Promised Neverland”</h2>
        <p>In 2021 I followed the minor Applied Game Design, this was also my first encounter with game design and
          development. The first project we were asked to build a 2D platform game in five weeks. Pressure was on, but
          it was hella fun.
        </p>
        <p>I was very intrigued by the storytelling of the manga “Promised Neverland” that made the starting point for
          my game; The Orphans. The orphans tells the story about Conny who’s one of the ten orphans that escaped from
          the orphanage after they found out they life in a world where kids are raised to be livestock for demons. The
          game starts when Conny is wandering through the creepy forest with the goal to find ingredients in order to
          create this recipe that needs to end the children livestock for demons. Along the way Conny has to face
          poisoned vegetation obstacles and demons to collect the ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>This was a individual project, I partially created my own assets (character, items, UI, enemy) the rest I got
          through the asset store provided by Unity. Everything was build in Unity and the audio was originated from
          different sources.
