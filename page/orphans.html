        <h2>2D game inspired by the manga
          “Promised Neverland”</h2>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>In 2021 I followed the minor Applied Game Design which was also my first encounter with game design and
            development. For the first project we had to build a 2D platform game in five weeks. Pressure was on, but
            it was hella fun. This minor showed me a different approach to interaction design which I found really
            interesting.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>I was very intrigued by the storytelling of the manga “Promised Neverland” that made the starting point for
            my game; The Orphans. The orphans tells the story about Conny who’s one of the ten orphans that escaped from
            the Paddy Field orphanage after they found out they life in a world where kids are raised to be livestock
            for demons.
            The game starts when Conny is wandering through the creepy forest with the goal to find ingredients in order
            to create this recipe that needs to end the children livestock for demons. Along the way Conny has to face
            poisoned vegetation obstacles and demons to collect the ingredients.

        <section class="alinea">
          <p>This was a individual project, partially self made assets and partially
            through downloadable asset platforms provided by Unity and Itch. Everything was build in Unity and the audio
            was originated from
            different sources.

        <h6>Research</h6>
        <p>The main
          theme of my game consists of combat and collecting items. Therefore I did my research by playing and analyzing
          games that fits my theme to
          determine what kind of mechanics I wanted to implement in my game. Based on those findings I created
          moodboards
          regarding to the environment, level design and characters to visualize the setting of the game.</p>

          <h6>Design proces</h6>
          <p>Based on the moodboards and prior research, the setting was in a dark forest with good amount of
            platforming which translates to the level designs. Characters based on the story: Conny the orphan an
            innocent yet powerful girl who urges to survive in the woods and the demons hungry creatures looking for
            human
            flesh. Went for manga type of artstyle that's visually not too detailed.

        <h6>The final product</h6>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>After five weeks of many iterations and testing, I built a game that at first is quite slow paced but it
            can get challenging later on. The goal is to survive the obstacles
            and enemies in order to collect all the ingredients. </p>
