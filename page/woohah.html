        <h2>Innovative experience by
          implementing a streaming service</h2>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>For my first year project, we were asked to create an innovative experience for a music festival by
            implementing a streaming service. Woohah, perhaps the largest hiphop festival in Europe brings the hiphop
            community together in large numbers. Together with other genres, they define Spotifyâ€™s tremendous succes,
            however this seems not to hit the music lovers.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p>This application allows visitors to explore Spotify in a way of not only streaming music, but getting more
            engaged with their favorite artists. Leaving an immersive experience making
            Spotify
            more attractive to the Woohah visitors.</p>

        <section class="alinea">
          <h6>Problem statement</h6>
          <h3>Where the musiclovers at?</h3>
          <p>Generally, Spotify targets to the average music streamer. Anyone who listens to music can lose themselves
            in the limitless catalogue of music on their device. However,
            there's group of musiclovers whom are almost inmersed in the artist who wants to know
            everything about them. They're not using the streamingservice
            because it lacks all kinds of information about artists, such as reviews
            of albums, video clips and documentaries.
          </p>
        </section>
        <h6>Research</h6>
        <section class="alinea">
          <p> I
            conducted
            deskresearch and surveys regarding to the festival and the streaming service. To find out how Woohah
            attracts their
            visitors, what Spotify currently has to offer, the concurrence between different platforms and how
            other
            companies increase their brand
            awareness on festivals.

            <ul class="bulletpoints">
              <li>Attract new visitors to Spotify platform</li>
              <li>Show that Spotify offers more than streaming music</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <section class="alinea">
          <h3>Survey findings</h3>
          <p>
            <ul class="bulletpoints">
              <li>Average visitor of Woohah festival are between 18-24 years old</li>
              <li>An average day at Woohah consist of eat, sleep, drink, smoke, concerts and repeated</li>
              <li>They enjoy discovering new artists during the festival besides only visiting their favorite artists
              </li>
              <li>Lyrics, connecting more with events and information about artists are the missing features on
                Spotify</li>

          <h6>Ideation</h6>
          <h3>Three concepts</h3>
          <p>Based on the findings through research, I created three concepts that possibly can catch the visitors
            attention during the festival. By implementing a physical object in the festival combined with a digital
            application, leaving an immersive experience. At the end it turned out to be a combination of the first two
            concepts.</p>

        <section class="alinea">
          <h6>Look & Feel</h6>
          <h3>Combine both brand identities</h3>
          <p>The idea of creating a combination of both brand identities is to engage a famiiar sense of style to the
            user. By implementing Woohah's brand identity into's Spotify's platform. The user
            should
            be able to recognize Spotify's design pattern in Woohah's brand identity.</p>

        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p>During my research I discovered that companies are quite creative when it comes to raising brand awareness
          during events. This
          encouraged me to be more creative and to look beyond your typical marketing strategies. Something Woohah
          visitors would appreciate. Survey findings stated that people miss engagements from festivals in the streaming
          platform. Which is why I created a collaboration app of Spotify x
          Woohah by merging the two platforms. Everything about the festival at one glance and the ability to search in
          the
          limitless library of songs in Spotify. To me this is the most subtle way to promote a brand without explicitly
          trying to engage people use your service or product.
