          <h2>Innovative experience by
            implementing a streaming service</h2>
          <p>For my first year project, we were asked to create an innovative experience for a music festival by
            implementing a streaming service. Woohah, perhaps the largest hiphop festival in Europe brings the hiphop
            community together in large numbers. Together with other genres, they define Spotifyâ€™s tremendous succes,
            however this seems not to hit the diehard music lovers.</p>

          <p>This application allows visitors to explore Spotify in a way of not only streaming music, but immerse the
            experience of artist by adapting the platform to the festival. Leaving an immersive experience making
            Spotify
            more attractive to the Woohah visitors.</p>
