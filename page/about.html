      <section class="about-content">
        <p>My interests happens to be always involved with art by absorbing, creating, and sharing it. Ever since I was
          a
          kid
          I
          enjoyed making things myself because it lives up my imagination. Studying Communication and Multimedia Design
          made me consciously having a better understanding for
          people, their needs and behaviour.</p>
        <p>It's hard to say what I like, because of my large interests and that probably translates to my work. What I
          do
          know is
          that I'm passionate about experimenting with my developed skillset I gained the past years as a student, to create meaningful yet
          functional solutions that'll make a proper fit to the user. Fun creations can also be
          meaningful :).
        </p>
        <p>When I'm not behind my desk, you'd
          most likely
          find me in a dance studio or wandering outside looking for foodies.
