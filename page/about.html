      <section class="about-content">
        <p>My interests happens to be always involved with art by absorbing, creating, and sharing it. Ever since I was
          a
          kid
          I
          enjoyed making things myself because it lives up my imagination. Studying Communication and Multimedia Design,
          made me consciously having a better understanding for
          people, their needs and behaviour. </p>
        <p>It's hard to say what I like, because I like a lot and that probably translates to my work. What I
          do
          know is
          that I enjoy creating fun things that hopefully enlighten peoples days. When im not behind my desk, you'd
          likely
          find me vibin in the dance studio or wandering outside sniffing for foodies.</p>
