          <h2>Digital reflection tool for Child Protection Officers</h2>
          <p>Social workers specialized in child protection (CP social workers) are responsible for helping broken
            families. They map out where the bottlenecks within the family lies and seeks for the right help. Their goal
            is ensuring welfare and wellbeing of the children.</p>
          <h6>Problem statement</h6>
          <p>Due to the increased workload of CP social workers, they hardly get to self-reflecting. Also, the
            obstruction
            caused by current reflecting tools are experienced as time consuming and not insightful. These methods
            consist
            of booklet paper forms (known as the case-note) being used during supervisions. However, in the current
            state
            due to the high demanded workload reflecting is not prioritized.</p>
          <h6>The benefits of reflecting</h6>
          <p>In order to develop in their workfield, CP social workers actively self-reflect after an event. These
            events
            consist of supervisions or counsils with families. Reflection allows them to plan, articulate, evaluate
            and learn in the complex issues that they face daily. The importance of reflecting, is to breakdown and
            critically analyze the processes that occur in decision making in child protection. This leads to develop a
            sense of what has achieved, what is likely to be achieved and could be done better. Resulting to provide
            better help for the child and the family.</p>
          <h6>Design Challenge</h6>
          <p>How can I help CP social workers gaining insights on their learning points through a digital interactive
            application, in order to efficiently take care of their development process. As a result, knowing what to
            tackle in their development.</p>
          <h6>Concept</h6>
          <p>Joi provides insights for the CP social workers on troubled situations after consults with families, in
            order
            to reflect quickly and insightfully on their actions. This works through an application that makes it
            possible
            to record audio clips and via sensors - smartwatch to measure stress that occurs during a counsil. With this
            collected data, they can quickly contribute input during supervisions with their collegues, supervisors or
            experts.</p>
