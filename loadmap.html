                        How can we design a solution for 2030 that also takes technology into consideration to allow
                        Amsterdam citizens to easily book a charging station and to allow them to charge their EV?

                        <br>
                        An application where Amsterdam citizens can book a charging station through an application.
                        Showcasing the available spots in the area, the amount of spots available at that area and the
                        route directions to the station.

                        This intregated charging pass displays the duration of charging the verhicle,
                        history of charges, duration and cost. This is the same method as how Apple Pay
                        works through face-ID when you hold the phone against the charging station.
