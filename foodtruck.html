                        Lots of foodtruck owners rent their foodtrucks through Foodtruckbooking.com, but all the owners
                        can agree that the website is a complete mess. The orginisation behind Rollende keukens (an
                        annual foodtruck
                        festival) came with the idea to develop a new appplication to compete with the website. </p>

                        <br>
                        Create an application where you can switch between profiles as an owner of the foodtrucks or as
                        a renter.
