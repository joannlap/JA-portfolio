        <h2>Digital reflection tool for Child Protection Officers</h2>
        <p>Social workers specialized in child protection (CP social workers) are responsible for helping dysfuntional
          families. They map out where the bottlenecks within the family lies and seeks for the right help. Their goal
          is ensuring welfare and wellbeing of the children.</p>
        <p>Due to the increased workload of CP social workers, they hardly get to self-reflection. Also, the
          obstruction
          caused by current reflecting tools are experienced as time consuming and not insightful. These methods consist
          of booklet paper forms (known as the case-note) being used during supervisions. However, in the current state
          due to the high demanded workload there isnâ€™t much room for self reflection.</p>
        <p>Joi provides insights for the CP social workers on troubled situations after consults with families, in order
          to reflect quickly and insightfully on their actions. This works through an application that makes it possible
          to record audio clips and via sensors - smartwatch to measure stress that occurs during a counsil. With this
          collected data, they can quickly contribute input during supervisions with their collegues, supervisors or
          experts.</p>
